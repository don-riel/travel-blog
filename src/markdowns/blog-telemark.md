place: "telemark"
intro: "I have been busy with school, internship and work for the last few weeks--- so to destress and feel a little bit of tranquility for a while, I searched through AirBnb. Luckily I saw a very interesting cabin to stay for the weekend and to my surprise, it was just a few hours away from Oslo."
